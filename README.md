## OVERVIEW
Design Thinking is an iterative process in which we seek to understand the user, challenge 
assumptions and redefine problems in an attempt to identify alternative strategies and solutions. 
Design Thinking provides a solution-based approach to solving problems. It is applicable to 
anything that entails creating innovative ideas and solving problems. It is a systematic process 
of thinking which empowers even the most traditional thinker to develop new, innovative 
solutions to the problem at hand. Everybody can be creative by following this process. It is 
human-centered creativity with purpose. 

## COMPONENTS
• GSM Modlue
• SIM 800 module  
• Network LED  
• 12 DV power input  
• SIM slot  
• RS232  
• SMA Antenna  
• USB 2 cable name in putty app

## WORKING

The GSM module includes a 12V power adapter jack, an RS232 serial interface for connecting to a laptop, and a range of other components. It has a transmitter, receiver, and ground pins located below the RS232 section. Additionally, the module has a slim slot for a SIM card, as well as a microphone, speaker, and an antenna for enhanced signal reception.To power the GSM module, first connect a 12V lamp adapter to the power input. Insert a 2G SIM card into the SIM slot since the module supports only 2G networks. Next, connect a USB 2.0 cable from the RS232 port on the GSM module to your laptop. Install the PuTTY application on your laptop to facilitate communication with the GSM module. Configure PuTTY by selecting the appropriate USB 2.0 serial cable type.The GSM module is designed to send SMS messages and make calls using its transmitter, receiver, and ground pins. It translates AT commands into serial data. The module includes a chip that converts these commands into TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) output, which is why direct connection to a microcontroller is not possible. Instead, the RS232 serial connection to the laptop is used. With the PuTTY application properly set up, you can use it to send messages and make calls through the GSM module.

## CONCLUSION
The "Ambulance Booth" project is designed to address the critical need for timely emergency response in rural areas by providing a reliable and efficient system for dispatching ambulances. With its user-friendly interface and GSM-based communication, the booth ensures rapid alerting of emergency services, significantly reducing response times. This initiative not only enhances access to life-saving medical care but also improves overall healthcare infrastructure in underserved communities. By bridging the gap between remote areas and emergency services, the project aims to save lives and promote better health outcomes for rural populations.
